  What happens when a CA is hacked.</strong> DigiNotar in 2011 had a serve security breach which resulted in a large number of fraudulently issued certificates. These certificates included domains of Yahoo, Mozilla, WordPress and Tor. As a browser is responsible for the list of verified authorities it is not easy to update this list when one authority can no longer be trusted. All major browsers issued security updates blacklisting DigiNotar's root certificate.

  An investigation into the hacking by Dutch-government appointed Fox-IT consultancy identified 300,000 Iranian Gmail users as the main target of the hack (targeted subsequently using man-in-the-middle attacks), and suspected that Iranian government was behind the hack.

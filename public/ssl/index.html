  <h2>SSL</h2>
  <p>
    SSL (pronounced as separate letters) is short for <em>Secure Sockets Layer</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</strong> is a protocol developed by Netscape for transmitting private documents via the Internet. SSL uses a cryptographic system that uses two keys to encrypt data âˆ’ a public key known to everyone and a private or secret key known only to the recipient of the message.

<h2>How SSL Works</h2>

<p>
  When a Web browser tries to connect to a website using SSL, the browser will first request the web server identify itself. This prompts the web server to send the browser a copy of the SSL Certificate. The browser checks to see if the SSL Certificate is trusted --  if the SSL Certificate is trusted, then the browser sends a message to the Web server. The server then responds to the browser with a digitally signed acknowledgement to start an SSL encrypted session. This allows encrypted data to be shared between the browser and the server. You may notice that your browsing session now starts with https (and not http).
